NO WARRANTY. NO SECURITY HARDENING. NO LIABILITY.

This tool is provided as-is for honest device bring-up and debugging by the person running it.

It is NOT designed for:
- hostile or multi-user environments
- untrusted or malicious log inputs
- automated CI, sandboxing, or adversarial use
- running as root or against system paths

Assumptions:
- You trust the device you are porting
- You trust the logs you are analyzing
- You are running as a normal user on your own machine

If you share output publicly, you MUST use --safe.
If you do not use --safe, treat all outputs as private.

Use at your own risk.
